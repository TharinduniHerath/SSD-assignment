## Vulnerability 10 - SSL/TLS Not Implemented

### 4.10.1 Identified Issues

The "SSL/TLS not implemented" vulnerability occurs when a web application operates without proper SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption for data transmission between client and server. This creates significant security risks:

#### **Issue 1: Data Interception**
- **Problem**: Users' sensitive data such as login credentials, passwords, personal information, and payment details can be intercepted during transmission by attackers
- **Risk**: High risk to users' privacy and identity theft
- **Impact**: Unencrypted data transmission exposes all user communications to potential eavesdropping

#### **Issue 2: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
- **Problem**: Attackers can observe and easily modify messages before passing them between client and server
- **Risk**: Data integrity compromise and potential data manipulation
- **Impact**: Attackers can inject malicious content or steal sensitive information during transmission

### 4.10.2 How is the vulnerability fixed?

#### **Solution: Using mkcert for Local SSL/TLS Implementation**

To address the SSL/TLS implementation vulnerability in the local development environment, I implemented a comprehensive solution using mkcert, a tool designed to generate locally trusted SSL certificates without requiring commercial Certificate Authority (CA) services.

#### **Implementation Steps:**

##### **Step 1: Install mkcert**
```bash
# Install mkcert using Chocolatey (Windows package manager)
choco install mkcert
```

##### **Step 2: Set Up Local Certificate Authority**
```bash
# Create a local CA that will be trusted by the system and browsers
mkcert -install
```

##### **Step 3: Generate SSL Certificates**
```bash
# Generate SSL certificates for localhost development
mkcert -cert-file ./cert.pem -key-file ./key.pem localhost
```

##### **Step 4: Configure React for HTTPS**
```javascript
// Environment configuration for React development server
HTTPS=true
SSL_CRT_FILE=./cert.pem
SSL_KEY_FILE=./key.pem
```

#### **Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// server.js - HTTPS Configuration
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

// Load SSL certificates
const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('./key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('./cert.pem')
};

// Create HTTPS server
const server = https.createServer(options, app);

server.listen(process.env.PORT || 4000, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ HTTPS Server started on port ${process.env.PORT || 4000}`);
});
```

#### **Security Benefits:**
- **Encrypted Communication**: All data transmission is encrypted using TLS
- **Authentication**: Server identity is verified through SSL certificates
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents data tampering during transmission
- **MITM Protection**: Mitigates man-in-the-middle attack risks

## Vulnerability 11 - Insecure File Uploads

### 4.11.1 Identified Issues

File uploading is an essential feature in modern web applications for sharing documents, images, videos, and other files. However, if not properly handled, it becomes a serious security threat:

#### **Issue 1: Lack of Validation**
- **Problem**: No validation on uploaded files allows users to upload malicious files containing scripts or executable code
- **Risk**: Remote code execution (RCE) or server exploitation
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full system control

#### **Issue 2: No Size Restrictions**
- **Problem**: Absence of file size limits allows attackers to upload extremely large files
- **Risk**: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- **Impact**: Server resources are consumed, leading to reduced performance and potential service unavailability

#### **Issue 3: Insufficient File Name Sanitization**
- **Problem**: Poorly sanitized file names can contain special characters or path traversal sequences
- **Risk**: Directory traversal attacks and unauthorized file access
- **Impact**: Attackers can access files or directories outside the intended upload directory

### 4.11.2 How is the vulnerability fixed?

#### **Solution: Comprehensive File Upload Security**

I implemented a multi-layered security approach to address all identified file upload vulnerabilities:

#### **Fix 1: MIME Type Validation**
```javascript
// File upload middleware with MIME type validation
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

// Define allowed MIME types for images only
const allowedMimeTypes = [
  'image/jpeg',
  'image/png', 
  'image/webp'
];

const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (allowedMimeTypes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, and WebP images are allowed.'), false);
  }
};
```

#### **Fix 2: Maximum File Size Limitation**
```javascript
// Configure multer with size limits
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Generate unique filename with timestamp
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});

const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024, // 5MB limit
    files: 1 // Only one file per request
  }
});
```

#### **Fix 3: File Name Sanitization**
```javascript
// File name sanitization function
const sanitizeFileName = (fileName) => {
  // Remove or replace characters that are not alphanumeric, dots, underscores, or hyphens
  return fileName
    .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '_')
    .replace(/\.{2,}/g, '.') // Replace multiple dots with single dot
    .replace(/^\.+|\.+$/g, ''); // Remove leading/trailing dots
};

// Enhanced filename generation
const generateSafeFileName = (originalName) => {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const sanitizedName = sanitizeFileName(originalName);
  const extension = path.extname(sanitizedName);
  const baseName = path.basename(sanitizedName, extension);
  
  return `${baseName}_${timestamp}${extension}`;
};
```

#### **Complete Upload Handler:**
```javascript
// Express route with secure file upload
app.post('/api/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  try {
    if (!req.file) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'No file uploaded' });
    }

    // Additional validation
    if (req.file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'File size exceeds 5MB limit' });
    }

    // Generate safe filename
    const safeFileName = generateSafeFileName(req.file.originalname);
    
    // Process the uploaded file
    const fileInfo = {
      originalName: req.file.originalname,
      safeName: safeFileName,
      size: req.file.size,
      mimeType: req.file.mimetype,
      path: req.file.path
    };

    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'File uploaded successfully',
      file: fileInfo
    });

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Upload error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'File upload failed' });
  }
});
```

#### **Security Benefits:**
- **RCE Prevention**: MIME type validation prevents execution of malicious scripts
- **DoS Protection**: File size limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Filename sanitization prevents directory traversal
- **Data Integrity**: Safe file handling ensures system stability

## Vulnerability 12 - Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By"

### 4.12.1 Identified Issues

The "X-Powered-By" vulnerability occurs when a web server or application discloses information about its underlying technology through the HTTP response header "X-Powered-By":

#### **Issue 1: Technology Detection**
- **Problem**: Attackers can detect the software stack your application uses (e.g., Express.js, PHP, ASP.NET)
- **Risk**: Reconnaissance and targeted attack planning
- **Impact**: Attackers can research specific vulnerabilities associated with the identified technology stack

#### **Issue 2: Targeted Attacks**
- **Problem**: Knowledge of specific technology enables attackers to exploit known weaknesses or bugs in that framework
- **Risk**: Increased likelihood of successful attacks
- **Impact**: Attackers can use framework-specific attack vectors and exploit known vulnerabilities

### 4.12.2 How is the vulnerability fixed?

#### **Solution: Remove Technology Disclosure Headers**

I implemented a comprehensive solution to prevent information disclosure through HTTP headers:

#### **Implementation using Helmet.js:**
```javascript
// server.js - Security headers configuration
const helmet = require('helmet');

// Configure Helmet with security headers
app.use(helmet({
  // Remove X-Powered-By header
  hidePoweredBy: true,
  
  // Additional security headers
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  
  // Prevent clickjacking
  frameguard: { action: 'deny' },
  
  // XSS protection
  xssFilter: true,
  
  // Prevent MIME type sniffing
  noSniff: true,
  
  // Force HTTPS
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

#### **Alternative Implementation (Manual):**
```javascript
// Manual header removal
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Remove X-Powered-By header
  res.removeHeader('X-Powered-By');
  
  // Remove other potentially revealing headers
  res.removeHeader('Server');
  res.removeHeader('X-AspNet-Version');
  res.removeHeader('X-AspNetMvc-Version');
  
  next();
});
```

#### **Verification:**
```bash
# Test to verify headers are removed
curl -I http://localhost:4000

# Expected output (X-Powered-By should be absent):
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off
# X-Frame-Options: DENY
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
# X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
# Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

#### **Security Benefits:**
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Prevents technology stack disclosure
- **Reconnaissance Prevention**: Makes it harder for attackers to identify specific vulnerabilities
- **Enhanced Security**: Additional security headers provide comprehensive protection
- **Compliance**: Meets security best practices for information disclosure prevention

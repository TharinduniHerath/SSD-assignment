    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      // ... additional CSP directives
    },
  },
  frameguard: { action: 'deny' },  // Prevent clickjacking
  xssFilter: true,  // XSS protection
  noSniff: true,    // Prevent MIME sniffing
  hsts: {           // HTTP Strict Transport Security
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```
